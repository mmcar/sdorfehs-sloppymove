# sdorfehs-sloppymove

adds focus-follows-mouse to sdorfehs

quick and dirty fork of https://github.com/cactus-d/ratpoison-sloppymove

basically just did find-and-replace ratpoison with sdorfehs and it worked

note that this behavior will conflict with sdorfehs' 'warp' setting. If you find a way around this let me know.


## Use

Add to your sdorfehs config

```
exec sdorfehs-sloppymove
```


## installation
```
make
make install
```
